							<h6>
								Rarely Seen Trapping Footage
							</h6>
							<p>
								We see photos and videos of coyotes, bobcats, foxes and other animals suffering in traps set on land, but there are other animals suffering that often go unseen. This video captures mink, muskrat, beavers and other wildlife drowning in traps out of public sight. Trappers don't want the public to see this, with good reason.Traps that are called "quick kill" are misleading. Otters and beavers are often trapped in "kill" traps by the tail or abdomen and drowned which can take up to 15 minutes. Leghold traps are set on land near thewater for aquatic mammals like otters. The traps drown the trapped animals as they flee to the water for safety, since the attached cables don't allow the animal to resurface.

					<h2>Trapping In Vermont</h2>
					<h4>Here are some facts about trapping in Vermont:</h4>
					<p>
						• Traps are not selective.
						<br>
						• Traps inflict prolonged suffering.
						<br>
						• Traps catch dogs and cats.
						<br>
						• Traps catch endangered, protected, and threatened species.
						<br>
						• Traps cause animals to chew through their limbs to free themselves.
						<br>
						• Traps may be set on public land, including National Wildlife Refuges, with no required signage.
						<br>
						• Traps may be set right near trails and trail heads with no required setbacks!
						<br>
						• Traps are baited with food items and lures that attract pets and endangered species.
						<br>
						• Furs are not selling, so many trappers are stockpiling carcasses or just tossing their bodies like garbage, which is clear wanton waste.
						<br>
						• Trappers trap for recreation and hobby.
						<br>
						• There are no standards by which trapped animals must be killed, so they are bludgeoned, stomped on – to crush the heart and lungs, drowned, choked, strangled, and if the animal is lucky, s/he is shot.
						<br>
						 • Out of season trapping, "in defense of property", is completely unregulated. Animals may suffer in traps for days before the trapper comes back. No reporting is required.
						<br>
						• Trappers use the term "SSS" meaning, shoot, shovel and shut-up when they trap a dog or cat.
						<br>
						• There is no limit on the number of traps a trapper may set at once, which means areas can be saturated with them. 
						<br>
						• There are no bag limits on the number of animals that may be trapped (in season.)
						<br>
						• Trappers are not required to report "incidental takes", including owls, eagles, ravens and other protected species!
